Plan for Alien Invasion 
    GAME ELEMENTS
        # Ship
        The ship appears at the bottom center of the screen.
        The player can move the ship left or right by using the left and right arrow keys respectively.
        The player fires bullets using the space-bar key.
        The ship cannot be allowed to move outside the borders of the screen.

        # Aliens
        The aliens will be drawn to the screen at the beginning of the game.
        The aliens will start by moving left.
        Anytime the end aliens reach the end of the screen, they move down by a certain amount and then change direction.
    GAMEPLAY


Ideas to extend the basic Alien Invasion.
    - Include a dark mode where the ship changes it's color to the background color using the pygame method 'fill' for surfaces.
    - Create an option for the ship to teleport(come out through the other side) once it reaches either edge of the screen.
    - Create support for full-screen mode and minimizing. Shrink the game screen and aliens when minimizing.
